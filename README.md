# Ironsworn Obsidian Template

Welcome to the Ironlands! Check out the main site for [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) by Shawn Tomkin for addtitional resources and game materials. This package is a bundle of community creations to hopefuly make a flexible and fun workspace to play out adventures.

The majority of the work here was done by others. I am but a humble curator. The included oracle files are modified from the work of [grimborg](https://github.com/grimborg/obsidian-ironsworn). The Ironsworn moves and assets files are converted from the work done by [rsek](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn) for compatiablity with Obsidian. I wrote the included css snippet to give the journal a more conversational feel. Not everyone role plays solo ttrpgs, but I do. Enable them if you wish.

This package also includes a handfull of Obsidian community plugins to assist you through playing Ironsworn. Use at your own risk. I have provided links to all resources used below if you prefer the hands on approach.

## the easy road 

Do the stuff, unless you just don't feel like it. I have those days too.

1. Put code in a local folder.
2. You need Obsidian. Install it.
3. Use Obsidan to open local folder as vault.
4. Enable plugins at your own risk. Scary...
5. Make a new epic vow and HAVE FUN!
