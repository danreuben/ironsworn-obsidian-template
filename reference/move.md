On a **strong hit**, you make your way safely out of the site. Take +1 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you find your way out, but this place exacts its price. Choose one.

* You are weary or wounded: [[#Endure Harm]].
* The experience leaves you shaken: [[#Endure Stress]].
* You are delayed, and it costs you.
* You leave behind something important.
* You face a new complication as you emerge from the depths.
* A denizen plots their revenge.

On a **miss**, a dire threat or imposing obstacle stands in your way. [[#Reveal a Danger]]. If you survive, you may make your escape.

## Optional Delve Moves

### Reveal a Danger (alternate version)

When **you encounter a risky situation within a site**, envision the danger or roll on the following table.

Roll  | Result
------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-22  | You encounter a hostile denizen.
23-42 | You face an environmental or architectural hazard.
43-58 | A discovery undermines or complicates your quest.
59-64 | You confront a harrowing situation or sensation.
65-70 | You face the consequences of an earlier choice or approach.
71-76 | The path is blocked or trapped.
77-82 | A resource is diminished, broken, or lost.
83-88 | You face a perplexing mystery or tough choice.
89-94 | You lose your way or are delayed.
95-00 | Roll twice more on this table. Both results occur. If they are the same result, make it worse.

### Mark Your Failure

When **you make a move and score a miss**, mark a tick on your failure track. If **you score a miss when making a progress move**, mark two ticks.

### Learn From Your Failures

***Progress Move***

When **you spend time reflecting on your hardships and missteps**, and your failure track is +6 or greater, roll your challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.

On a **strong hit**, you commit to making a dramatic change. Take 3 experience and clear all progress. Then, choose one.

* Adjust your approach: Discard a single asset, and take 2 experience for each marked ability.
* Make an oath: [[#Swear an Iron Vow]], and reroll any dice.
* Ready your next steps: Take +3 momentum.

On a **weak hit**, you learn from your mistakes. Take 2 experience and clear all progress.

On a **miss**, you’ve learned the wrong lessons. Take 1 experience and clear all progress. Then, envision how you set off on an ill-fated path.

### Advance a Threat

When **you give ground to a threat through inaction, failure, or delay**, roll on the table below and envision how the change manifests in your world ([[#Ask the Oracle]] if unsure).

Roll  | Result
------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-30  | The threat readies its next step, or a new danger looms. If you are in a position to prevent this development, you may attempt to do so. If you succeed, [[#Reach a Milestone]]. Otherwise, mark menace.
31-70 | The threat works subtly to advance toward its goal, or the danger escalates. Mark menace.
71-00 | The threat makes a dramatic and immediate move, or a major event reveals new complications. Mark menace twice.

On a match, this development also exposes a surprising aspect of the threat’s plan or nature.

If **you mark the last box on the threat’s menace track**, the threat achieves its goal, or the final dire outcome occurs. You must [[#Forsake Your Vow]].

### Take a Hiatus

When **you spend an extended time recovering in a safe place while a threat is active**, do any of the following.

* Clear any marked conditions.
* Set your health, spirit, supply, and companion health to their maximum values.
* Set your momentum to its reset value.

Then, for each active threat, [[#Advance a Threat]].

### Wield a Rarity

When **you make a move aided by an augmented asset**, roll your rarity die in place of your action die.

On *any result* with 6 showing on the rarity die, the power of the rarity manifests in a dramatic and obvious way. You score an automatic **strong hit** and take +1 momentum.

On a *hit* with 5 showing on the rarity die, the power of the rarity manifests in a subtle way. Take +1 momentum.

On a *miss* with 1 showing on the rarity die, the rarity’s power fails or works against you.
