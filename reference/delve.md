# Delve Site

## Ancient Barrow

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet.
Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits,
soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and
crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways
carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

## Ancient Frozen Cavern

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

## Ancient Icereach

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

## Ancient Mine

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

## Ancient Ruin

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

## Ancient Sea Cave

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

## Ancient Stronghold

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms
and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark
land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

## Ancient Underkeep

**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site
contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and
relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The
knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures
may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

## Corrupted Barrow

**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by
dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the
residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked
into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who
walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down
to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with
strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the
edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by
corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits,
soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and
crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways
carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

## Corrupted Frozen Cavern

**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by
dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the
residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked
into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who
walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down
to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with
strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the
edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by
corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

## Corrupted Mine

**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by
dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the
residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked
into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who
walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down
to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with
strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the
edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by
corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the
residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked
into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down

edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by
corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

## Corrupted Sea Cave

**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by
dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the
residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked
into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who
walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down
to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with
strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the
edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by
corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms
and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark
land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

## Corrupted Tanglewood

**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by
dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the
residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked
into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who
walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down
to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with
strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the
edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by
corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet.
Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits,
soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and
crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways
carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

## Fortified Icereach

**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held
and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a
fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced
to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or
causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps
forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced

forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

## Fortified Ruin

**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held
and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a
fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced
to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or
causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps
forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

## Fortified Shadowfen

**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held
and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a
fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced
to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or
causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps
forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms
and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark
land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

## Fortified Underkeep

**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held
and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a
fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced
to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or
causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps
forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

## Hallowed Barrow

**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great
reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of
belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting
place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious
leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine
energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice
everything to defend this place.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet.
Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits,
soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and
crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways
carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

## Hallowed Frozen Cavern

**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great
reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of
belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting
place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious
leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine
energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice
everything to defend this place.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great
reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of
belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

## Hallowed Mine

**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great
reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of
belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting
place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious
leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine
energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice
everything to defend this place.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

## Hallowed Sea Cave

**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great
reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of
belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting
place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious
leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine
energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice
everything to defend this place.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms
and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark
land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

## Hallowed Tanglewood

**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great
reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of
belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting
place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious
leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine
energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice
everything to defend this place.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

## Haunted Barrow

**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site,
dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions
lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you
enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of
answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what
caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the
denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and
terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a
hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet.
Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits,
soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and
crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways
carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

## Haunted Icereach

**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site,
dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions
lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you
enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of
answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what
caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the
denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and
terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a
hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

## Haunted Ruin

**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site,
dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions
lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you
enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of
answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what
caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the
denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and
terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a
hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

## Haunted Stronghold

**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site,
dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions
lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you
enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of
answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what
caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the
denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and
terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a
hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms
and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark
land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

## Haunted Underkeep

**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site,
dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions
lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you
enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of
answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what
caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the
denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and
terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a
hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

## Infested Barrow

**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites,
overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The
denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous
for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes,
may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it
is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut
off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

## Infested Frozen Cavern

**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites,
overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The
denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous
for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes,
may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it
is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut
off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

## Infested Pass

**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites,
overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The
denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous
for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes,
may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it
is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut
off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

## Infested Sea Cave

**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites,
overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The
denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous
for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes,
may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it
is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut
off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

## Infested Tanglewood

**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites,
overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The
denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous
for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes,
may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it
is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut
off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

## Ravaged Barrow

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,
or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is
precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to
react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It
is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

## Ravaged Cavern

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,
or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is
precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to
react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It
is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet.
Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits,
soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and
crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways
carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

## Ravaged Frozen Cavern

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,

precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to

is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

## Ravaged Icereach

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,
or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is
precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to
react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It
is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

## Ravaged Ruin

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,
or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is
precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to
react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It
is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

## Ravaged Stronghold

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,
or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is
precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to
react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It
is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms
and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark
land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

## Ravaged Underkeep

**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war,
or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is
precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a
former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to
react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It
is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your
quest undone.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.

## Wild Barrow

**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our
control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our
shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures,
and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the
prey.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no
shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a
family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging
well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their
rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly
labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and
power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost,
and vows unfulfilled.

carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain.
What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?

## Wild Frozen Cavern

**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our
control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our
shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures,
and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the
prey.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are
found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved
through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold.
Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain,
shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a
stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing
discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be
distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no
sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.

control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse
of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites
are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast
icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog
the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain
is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food
is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships,
locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these
places and were forever lost.

## Wild Mine

**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our
control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our

and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the
bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are
offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and
mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by
forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces.
From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious
goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often
dig into places best left undisturbed.

## Wild Pass

**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our
control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our
shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures,
and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the
prey.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and
mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise
impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host
of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take
advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes
undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a
pile of mountain stones.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying
edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great
communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly
adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home
only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful
legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent
of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people
may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the
prey.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and
unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep
into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often
lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The
chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can
bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately
through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a
pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not
welcome here.

## Wild Shadowfen

**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our
control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our
shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures,
and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the
prey.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in
mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of
gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in
the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the
promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your
constant companion.

land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and
other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the
comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the
walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart
ironbound shield.

## Wild Tanglewood

**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our
control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold
sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our
shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures,
and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the
comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the
prey.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick
wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the
sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries
foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who
reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others
fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even
near settled areas, the tangles still stand.

sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our

and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a
mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the
Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable
darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon
the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or
the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for
protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use
the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon
discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.
